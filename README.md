# FPSGameBySakanako
My first real fps game

This project is a personal FPS demo focused on **input responsiveness**, **controller support**, and **modern FPS control feel**.  
It is not intended to be a full game, but rather a playable and well-polished prototype.

## 🎯 Current Goals

- Implement **responsive controller stick input curves**
  - Linear
  - Traditional / Standard (COD-style)
  - Optional dynamic curve (if feasible)

- Add **pre-input mechanics**
  - Input buffering
  - Early input detection for smoother player actions
